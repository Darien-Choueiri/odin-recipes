# odin-recipes

This project is a simple html website containing a homepage and three different recipes that I enjoy.

In working on this project I have learned how to create HTML boilerplate and use the following HTML features: unordered and ordered lists, links, images, paragraphs, and headers.

This is project serves a refresher for me on HTML
